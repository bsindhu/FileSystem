FileSystem
==========
The ThreadOs is an operating simulator and has the file system similar to UNIX file system.

Performance :
In order to free a block without a doubly linked list scheme is extremely inefficient because it requires traversal of the free List block by block until the end is found. 

The file system has only single indirect block, this limits the file system in growing.
